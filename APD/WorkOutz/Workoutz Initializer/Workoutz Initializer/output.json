Lengthen your legs and stretch your heels to the back of the room. Your hands should be under your shoulders.<\/p>  <p>Take a few deep breaths. Notice how your abdominals want to rest on the ball when you inhale.<br \/>Exhale and pull your abdominals away from the ball. Try to keep them pulled away even when you inhale. This is your abdominal engagement.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 2<\/h2>  <p>Once you have established your abdominal engagement, slowly walk your hands forward until your feet come off the floor. Continue walking out until the fronts of your thighs or knees are resting on the top of the ball in a plank position.<\/p>  <p>It is important to keep your ribcage knitted together and the abdominals strong in order to maintain a rigid torso. Your legs should be very active so that your entire body is straight as a board and aligned parallel to the floor. <br \/>Keep your shoulder blades pulling away from your shoulders and toward your hips. Elbows must be straight and hands directly under your shoulders. Keep your legs active.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 3<\/h2>  <p>Curling Phase: Exhale and slowly bend your knees towards your chest. The ball will roll forward as your knees tuck under your torso and your hips lift toward the ceiling. <br \/>NOTE: This brings your body into somewhat of a handstand position. Be aware of your shoulder strength and keep the elbows straight.<\/p>  <p>Ideally, your knees are under your hips, your hips are toward the ceiling and your shins are on top of the ball. Hold this position for a breath.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 4<\/h2>  <p>Lowering Phase: Inhale and straighten your legs, rolling the ball back the plank position.<\/p>  <p><br \/>MODIFICATION: If you are uncomfortable or feeling unsafe with your hips raised and shins on the ball, simply tuck your knees into your chest without lifting the hips.<\/p><\/span>                         <\/div>                      ","targetBodyPart":"Abs, Legs - Calves and Shins","imageUrl":"\/acefit\/img\/exerciselibrary\/large\/60-1.jpg"},{"name":"Seated Medicine Ball Trunk Rotations","descriptionHtml":"                         <div>                              <span id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_ChildContent_lblSimpleText\"><h2>Step 1<\/h2>  <p>Starting Position: Sit on a mat\/floor with your knees bent, feet together, and heels on the floor. Start with a light ball (1-2 lb) and increase the weight of the ball as your fitness level improves. Sit as tall as possible with your back erect so that your torso is perpendicular to the floor. If you have tightness in your back and legs that prevents you from getting into this position, try sitting on a cushion or a rolled mat in order to lift your hips and help facilitate a straighter spine. Hold the medicine ball close to your body between your navel and your ribcage. Use your breath to help engage the muscles of your core. On your exhale, imagine you are tightening a belt around your waist and deepen the contraction of the abdominals.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 2<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Rotation: Keeping the spine erect, exhale and slowly rotate your torso to one side, Imagine that the ball is buttoned to your torso. It should stay in place through the entire exercise. Do not allow the ball to drop toward the floor. Pause briefly at the end of the twist, inhale and then gently exhale while rotating completely to the opposite side. Repeat the movement back and forth.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 3<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Exercise Progression 1: When you can perform the movements in Step 2 easily and without strain, you can modify the starting position by slightly leaning back while keeping your knees bent and heels on the floor. Once again, keeping the ball buttoned to your torso, try to enhance rotation so that the elbow is close to, but not to resting on the floor. Keep your core and abdominal muscles active to prevent arching the back or low back discomfort during the exercise. This exercise variation increases the demands placed upon your abdominal muscles.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 4<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Exercise Progression 2: As you continue to progress, you can incorporate even greater challenge by modifying the starting position once again. Lean back halfway to the floor and lift your feet off the floor. Keep your knees bent and feet together. Once again keeping the ball buttoned to your torso, enhance the rotation by attempting to bring the elbow close to, but not to resting on, the floor. Try to keep the shoulders relaxed. Your back should remain straight. Keep your core and abdominal muscles active to prevent arching the back or low back discomfort during the exercise. This exercise variation increases the demands placed upon your abdominal muscles.<br \/>Intermediate and advanced rotational exercises should only be attempted after completing the beginner exercises.<\/p><\/span>                         <\/div>                      ","targetBodyPart":"Abs","imageUrl":"\/acefit\/img\/exerciselibrary\/large\/47-1.jpg"},{"name":"Ankle Flexion ","descriptionHtml":"                         <div>                              <span id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_ChildContent_lblSimpleText\"><h2>Step 1<\/h2>  <p>Starting Position: Sit with one leg stretched out in front. Secure a cable or resistance band around the ball of the outstretched foot. The resistance should be pulling the bottom of your foot away from you.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 2<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Start with your toes pointed away from your body and slowly pull your toes towards your shin. Return to your starting position slowly and with control Repeat.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 3<br \/><\/h2>  <p>The movement comes from your ankle, so avoid any bending or over straightening of your knee throughout the movement. Always aim to keep your foot aligned facing forward.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 4<br \/><\/h2>  <p>As an exercise progression, modify your movement to include a slight foot rotation as your toes pull toward your shin. The direction of your slight rotation should bring the big toe toward the inside border of your shin bone.<\/p>  <p>Attempt to sit upright and avoid any excessive arching or slouching in the low back.<\/p><\/span>                         <\/div>                      ","targetBodyPart":"Legs - Calves and Shins","imageUrl":"\/acefit\/img\/exerciselibrary\/large\/23-1.jpg"},{"name":"Stability Ball Prone Walkout","descriptionHtml":"                         <div>                              <span id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_ChildContent_lblSimpleText\"><h2>Step 1<\/h2>  <p>Starting Position: Lie on your stomach over the top of the stability ball.

This is your abdominal engagement<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 2<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Outward Phase: Gently exhale. With your abdominals engaged and your torso rigid, slowly walk your hands forward, lifting your legs off the floor. Your legs should be actively reaching toward the back of the room. Avoid allowing your legs to droop. It is important to keep your ribcage knitted together and the abdominals strong in order to maintain a rigid torso. Continue walking out until the fronts of your thighs or knees are resting on the top of the ball. The further you walk away from the ball, the greater the stability challenge. Go slowly and find the challenge that is just right for you. Keep your body rigid so that your legs and trunk form one continuous line. Your legs should be very active so that your entire body is straight as a board and aligned parallel to the floor.<br \/>Keep your shoulder blades pulling away from your shoulders and toward your hips. Your end position is where you can maintain stability with your hands directly under your shoulders, and elbows, torso and legs straight and strong. Hold this position briefly.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 3<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Return Phase: Inhale and slowly walk yourself backwards to your starting position, trying to maintain your stability and balance, moving backward smoothly.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 4<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Exercise Variation (1): To increase the balance challenge, walk yourself further out until the tops of your feet or toes rest on the top of the ball.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 5<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Exercise Variation (2): To further increase the balance challenge, raise one leg off the ball when you reach the end of the walkout phase.<\/p><\/span>                         <\/div>                      ","targetBodyPart":"Abs, Back","imageUrl":"\/acefit\/img\/exerciselibrary\/large\/62-1.jpg"},{"name":"Supermans","descriptionHtml":"                         <div>                              <span id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_ChildContent_lblSimpleText\"><h2>Step 1<\/h2>  <p>Starting Position: Lie on your stomach on a mat or the floor with your legs outstretched behind you. Your toes are pointing toward the wall behind you. Reach your arms out overhead with your palms facing each other. <br \/>Relax your neck and align your head with your spine.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 2<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Upward Phase: Exhale. Deepen your abdominal and core muscles to stabilize your spine and slowly and strongly reach both legs away from your torso until they lift a few inches off the floor. At the same time float both arms a few inches off the floor. Keep both legs and arms straight and allow any rotation in the arms, legs, shoulders or pelvis. Your head is aligned with your spine. Do not allow your head to lift up or to droop toward the floor. Do not allow the back to arch. Hold this position briefly.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 3<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Downward Phase: Gently inhale and lower your legs and arms back to your starting position without any movement in your low back or hips.<\/p>  <p><br \/>For professional guidance in your exercise program,<br \/>find an ACE-certified Personal Trainer in your area.

Your fingers should be pointing forward.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 2<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Engage your core and abdominal muscles. Imagine you are tightening a corset<br \/>around your waistline. Keep your spine in a neutral position, avoid any excessive sagging or arching. Pull the shoulder blades toward your hips.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 3<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Upward Phase: In this exercise you are attempting to move the opposite arm and leg simultaneously. It is very helpful to use a mirror to help you with form adjustments. Begin by slowly lengthening the left leg until it is long and strong. Lift the leg off the floor until it is at or near parallel to the floor. The leg should not be lifted above hip height. This will help to avoid upward rotation at the hip.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 4<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Slowly raise and straighten right arm. Attempt to raise the arm until it is at, or near parallel, to the floor. Do not allow the shoulders to tilt upward. Keep both shoulders parallel to the floor. Your head is an extension of your spine and should remain aligned with the spine throughout the movement. Do not lift the head or let it sag downward.<br \/>NOTE: The leg and arm should only be raised as to heights that allow you to maintain the shoulders and pelvis in parallel to one another, the core engaged and the spine in neutral position.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 5<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Downward Phase: Gently lower yourself back to your starting position, maintaining balance and stability in the shoulders, pelvis and torso.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 6<\/h2>  <p>Alternating Sides: During this phase of changing sides, work very hard to keep the abdominals engaged. Imagine knitting your ribs together as though you were lacing up a tennis shoe. When you change sides, try to do so with minimal weight shift. Do not flop from one side to the next. Maintain balance and control.<\/p>  <p>The bird-dog is an excellent exercise to train the body how to stabilize the lumbar spine (low back) during upper and lower extremity movement. Never exceed your ability to control movement in the low back.<\/p><\/span>                         <\/div>                      ","targetBodyPart":"Abs, Back, Butt\/Hips","imageUrl":"\/acefit\/img\/exerciselibrary\/large\/14-1.jpg"},{"name":"Dumbbell Step-up","descriptionHtml":"                         <div>                              <span id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_ChildContent_lblSimpleText\"><h2>Step 1<\/h2>  <p>Starting Position: Stand with your feet parallel about hip width apart while holding dumbbells in your hands with palms facing inwards.

Your right arm should also bend to 90 degrees, driving it back from the shoulder until the upper arm lies approximately 45 degrees from vertical. Imagine you are running.<\/p>  <h2>Step 3<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Downward Phase: Inhale, keeping the abdominal\/core muscles engaged, bend your standing knee and slowly lower your body toward the floor. As you lower down, shift the hips backwards. Keep your body weight over the heel of your standing foot. As your body lowers, the suspended leg will drive backwards. Maintain the 90 degree bend at the knee. Your right arm should drive forward from the shoulder toward the end-position where the left arm started. Your left arm should simultaneously drive backwards to an end-position where the right arm started. Throughout the arm movements, squeeze the arms to the sides of your body and drive from the shoulders while keeping the 90 degree bend in the elbows. Continue lowering yourself. Keep your weight over your left heel until your right thigh and torso form a straight line with one another. Your left shinbone should aligned with or slightly ahead of the ball of your left foot.<\/p>  <h2>Step 4<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly press your body upward by pushing down against the floor through your left heel. The muscle action at the knee and hip bring the body back to your starting position.<\/p>  <h2>Step 5<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Exercise Variation (1): To increase the intensity of this exercise, move more explosively, extending the ankle, knee and hip joints to return to your start position.<\/p>  <h2>Step 6<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Exercise Variation (2): To further increase the intensity of the exercise, move the upper extremities in a variety of directions. For example: While the lower the legs continue to move front and back, the torso and\/or arms can move left and right. The torso may rotate as well.<br \/>Using the TRX as an assisted device reduces the load placed upon many joints.

The hips and torso should rise together. Keep the heels flat on the floor and knees aligned with the second toe.<\/p>  <p>Technique is very important in this lift. The tendency is to hold the shinbone too vertical which forces you to lean your torso too far forward.

Position the bar 1\" in front of your shins.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 3<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Keep your spine in neutral position. Your shoulders should pull down your back and away from you ears. Keep your chest lifted and your head in line with your spine or chin slightly lifted. Your heels are on the floor and your shoulders are over or slightly in front of the bar. Your gaze should be facing straight ahead or slightly upward.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 4<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Upward Phase: Before lifting, brace your core and abdominal muscles to stabilize and protect your spine. Straighten your knees and hips at the same time, bringing the bar off the floor and coming to a full standing position. You are pushing your feet down into the floor as you return to a full standing position. The barbell will rest against the front of your thighs with your arms straight, and shoulders pulled down and back. Your goal is to keep the bar close to your body as it moves upward.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 5<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Downward Phase: With control, begin this phase by hinging at the hips, shifting them back and down. Your hips and knees bend simultaneously. As you lower your hips the knees bend and will start to shift forward slowly. Try to prevent your knees from traveling too far forward past the toes. Keep the abdominals\/core muscles engaged and try to keep your back flat (do not tuck the tail or arch the low back). Lower the hips and shoulders together. Do not allow the spine to round. Keep the back long and shoulder blades pulling down. Imagine holding a pencil between your shoulder blades throughout both phases of the movement.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 6<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Grip Variations: With lighter weights, you may opt to grip the bar with both palms down or both palms up. Be sure the fingers are wrapped around the bar with either grip.<br \/>Technique is very important in this lift. Two common mistakes are (a) over arching the low back during the lifting and lowering phases and (b) not raising and lowering the hips and shoulders together.<\/p><\/span>                         <\/div>                      ","targetBodyPart":"Back, Butt\/Hips, Legs - Thighs, Full Body\/Integrated","imageUrl":"\/acefit\/img\/exerciselibrary\/large\/6-1.jpg"},{"name":"Bent Knee Push-up","descriptionHtml":"                         <div>                              <span id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_ChildContent_lblSimpleText\"><h2>Step 1<\/h2>  <p>Starting Position: Come to a hands and knees position (quadruped) on the mat with your hands directly under your shoulders; fingers facing forward and knees under your hips. ?Engage the abdominals and pull the shoulder blades down your back.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 2<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Reposition your knees as needed to create a straight line in your body from the knees, through the torso and out through the head.

Your elbows should remain close to the sides of your body or flare outwards slightly.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 4<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Upward Phase: Maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine, press upward through your arms. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upward. Continue pressing until the elbows are straight.<br \/>Push-ups place stress upon the wrist joints. To alleviate some of this stress you may opt to use dumbbells and grip the handles rather than place your hands on the floor. If your are pressing from an elevation such as a dumbbell, you do not need to lower your chest or chin to the floor, but rather lower yourself until your chest or chin are level with the dumbbell handles.<\/p><\/span>                         <\/div>                      ","targetBodyPart":"Arms, Chest, Shoulders","imageUrl":"\/acefit\/img\/exerciselibrary\/large\/13-1.jpg"},{"name":"Bodyweight Squat","descriptionHtml":"                         <div>                              <span id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_ChildContent_lblSimpleText\"><h2>Step 1<\/h2>  <p>Starting Position: Begin standing with your feet slightly wider than hip-width and your toes turned out slightly.

As many of us have weak glutes, this exercise can be performed as part of your pre-exercise warm-up. Given the moderate degree of complexity of the three movements, we recommend learning this exercise first without your arms and only progress to the arm drivers as you feel comfortable. It is suggested you first learn how to perform single leg-stands on the ground and forward lunges before performing these glute activation lunges.<\/p><\/span>                         <\/div>                      ","targetBodyPart":"Abs, Butt\/Hips, Legs - Thighs","imageUrl":"\/acefit\/img\/exerciselibrary\/large\/96-1.jpg"},{"name":"Mountain Climbers","descriptionHtml":"                         <div>                              <span id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_ChildContent_lblSimpleText\"><h2>Step 1<\/h2>  <p>Starting Position: Come to a hands and knees position on the floor with your toes pointed toward the floor.

Each partner reaches out his or her arms so that you can each grasp the other's forearms.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 2<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Downward Phase: Each partner should start the downward phase by hinging at the hips and shifting the hips back and down. This will also create a hinge-like movement at the knees. As you continue to lower your hips, the knees will start to shift forward slowly. Try to prevent your knees from moving too far forward beyond the toes. Brace your core to keep your trunk stable and spine straight. Each partner should maintain a firm grip and allow one another to lean back slightly in order to be able to sink deeper into the hips for greater range-of-motion.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 3<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Both partners continue to lower themselves until their thighs are near, or parallel with the floor. If the heels begin to lift off the floor or the torso begins to round, return to start position. Be aware of any movement that may occur at your feet, ankles and knees. Work to ensure that the feet do not move, the ankles do not collapse in or out and the knees remain lined up with the second toe. Return to a standing position.<br \/>Lowered Position: From the front, the knees should continue to remain aligned with the second toe, and body weight should be evenly distributed over both feet.

Exhale and press the feet into the floor through the heels. The hips and torso need to rise together, returning to the start position while keeping heels flat on the floor and knees aligned with the second toe.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 5<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Exercise Variation: Each partner can place his or her feet in a split-squat position. The feet should be hip width apart and one foot slightly in front of the other. Each partner can balance on a single leg and perform a single leg squat. The act of the partners holding on to one another during the squatting movement will help to maintain the balance on one leg.<\/p>  <p>Technique is very important in this lift. The tendency is to hold the shinbone too vertical, which forces you to lean your torso too far forward. Using a mirror for feedback, shift your shinbone forward while keeping your heels on the floor, then bring your torso upright, but do so from the hips and not through the low back. Squeeze your abdominals to help prevent the excess arching in the back with this correction. If using a squat rack, the safety rungs on the rack should be positioned at mid-thigh level.<\/p><\/span>                         <\/div>                      ","targetBodyPart":"Abs, Butt\/Hips, Legs - Thighs","imageUrl":"\/acefit\/img\/exerciselibrary\/large\/265-1.jpg"},{"name":"Single-arm, Single-leg Romanian Dead Lift ","descriptionHtml":"                         <div>                              <span id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_ChildContent_lblSimpleText\"><h2>Step 1<\/h2>  <p>Starting Position: Stand with your feet together, holding a dumbbell in your left hand.

Or be sure that you have a solid wall or medicine ball rebounder that can withstand the force of impact from a medicine ball.<br \/>Starting Position: Stand on the floor in a ready position with your feet hip-width apart. You should be at least 5-8 feet away from and directly facing your partner (or wall \/ rebounder). Each partner should maintain the spine in a neutral position (normal-to-flat), keeping the shoulder blades pulling down the back and chest lifted. Keep your head in line with your spine. Firmly hold a medicine ball with both hands right in front of your chest. Contract and brace the abdominals. Keep your hips pressed forward by contracting your glutes. Your head should be level and your eyes should be looking directly at the target.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 2<br \/><\/h2>  <p>The partner preparing to catch the medicine ball should stand with his or her feet firmly planted into the ground, with a slight bend at the hips. The abdominals should be engaged. Both hands should be held right in front of the chest in order to provide a target for the partner throwing the ball. The person throwing the ball steps forward with the right foot into a forward lunge. As the right foot hits the ground bend the left knee to allow the right hip to sink as you push the medicine ball away from your chest throwing it directly to your target.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 3<br \/><\/h2>  <p>The partner catching the ball should catch it in a standing position with the arms outstretched straight out in front of the body. As the medicine ball reaches the hands, the catcher absorbs and decelerates the ball, bringing it toward the chest. Once the catching partner receives the medicine ball, he or she should then step forward with the left leg into a forward lunge and throw the ball back to the partner who originated the throw. When waiting to receive a throw, one should be standing with a slight bend at the hips, feet hip width apart and the arms outstretched straight in front of the chest to create a target and prepare to catch the ball.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 4<br \/><\/h2>  <p>The partner who originated the throwing should again step forward with his or her right leg into a forward lunge and throw the medicine ball back to the other person who is standing with outstretched arms, prepared to catch the ball and step back into a forward lunge.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 5<br \/><\/h2>  <p>The partner catching the ball should catch the ball with both hands and the feet hip width apart before stepping forward into a forward lunge with the left leg to throw another chest pass back to the partner who originated the lunging and throwing movement. Perform this sequence a number of times before alternating and conducting the same number of lunge and throws stepping forward\/lunging with the other leg.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 6<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Exercise Variation: The partner catching the ball can balance on one leg to work on core stability while decelerating the forces related to catching the ball before stepping into the forward lunge.<br \/><br \/>During the entire throwing and catching sequence each partner should position his or her body with the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together). Each partner should keep his or her chest held up and out, the head in line with his or her spine and both hands out front while preparing to catch the ball (holding the hands in front of the body gives the partner throwing the ball a target to aim for when releasing the ball; the throwing partner should keep his or her eyes on the catching partner's hands to ensure good aim).<\/p><\/span>                         <\/div>                      ","targetBodyPart":"Abs, Back, Butt\/Hips, Chest, Shoulders, Full Body\/Integrated","imageUrl":"\/acefit\/img\/exerciselibrary\/large\/264-1.jpg"},{"name":"Overhead Triceps Stretch","descriptionHtml":"                         <div>                              <span id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_ChildContent_lblSimpleText\"><h2>Step 1<\/h2>  <p>Starting Position: Stand with feet hip-width apart and roll your shoulders down and back.

You and your training partner should stand facing each other with your feet hip-width apart and the right foot slightly in front of the left to create additional stability; your knees and hips should be slightly bent so that you each can sink into your hips and contract your abdominals (bracing) for additional stability. You and your partner should each position your body with the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders blades pulling down and back toward the hips (no shrugging). You and your partner should each keep your chest held up and out, with your heads in line with your spine or slightly lifted. Hold the handles firmly in both hands, palms are facing the ground. Pull back slightly to create opposing lines of pull.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 2<br \/><\/h2>  <p>You and your partner should each maintain an abdominal contraction with your feet planted on the floor to create stability through the hips and core. Both you and your partner pull back on the handles, at the same time. The pulling motion should be initiated from the shoulder blades. Pull the handles toward your ribcage. Keeping the elbows wide, engage the upper back and shoulder muscles.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 3<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Once you and your partner have pulled the handles back, both partners should hold the shoulder blades back and down. Holding this engagement in the shoulder blades, each partner straightens his or her right arm, as though you are \"punching\" toward your partner. Keep the left arm pulling back.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 4<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Pull the right arm back. Hold the contraction once again. Without allowing any movement in the right shoulder, reach the left arm forward. Keep the abdominals braced and alternate the arm movements. You and your partner should work together to provide resistance to one another while simultaneously pulling back on the bands to maintain tension in the band.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 5<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Exercise Variation: Start with slow, steady consistent movements to become used to providing manual resistance through the tension of the rubber tubing. To increase the intensity you can either stand further away from one another to create additional tension on the rubber or increase the speed of the movement to make it more of a power-based exercise.<br \/>Remember to keep your feet planted into the floor with your abdominals engaged and contracted (braced) to ensure spinal stability.<\/p><\/span>                         <\/div>                      ","targetBodyPart":"Arms, Back, Butt\/Hips","imageUrl":"\/acefit\/img\/exerciselibrary\/large\/267-1.jpg"},{"name":"Power Clean","descriptionHtml":"                         <div>                              <span id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_ChildContent_lblSimpleText\"><h2>Step 1<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Starting Position: Stand in front of a barbell, with your feet shoulder to hip-width apart and the balls of your feet directly under the bar. Your feet should point forward or be turned out slightly. Squat down to grasp the bar with fingers wrapped around the bar, and a closed-thumb grip. Your grip position should be immediately outside of your knees (slightly wider than shoulder width).<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 2<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Keep your back flat. Your elbows should be straight and your shoulders over the bar or slightly ahead of the bar. Your chest should be forward and your head aligned with your spine or chin slightly lifted. Your eyes are looking forward. Pull your shoulder blades down and back. Brace your abdominal \/ core muscles to stiffen your torso and support your spine. Keep these muscles engaged throughout the exercise.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 3<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Upward Movement - 1st Pull: Keeping a firm grip. Exhale and slowly push through your heels, straightening your hips and knees, lifting your hips and shoulders together. Maintain your shoulder, straight arm and flat back position. Keep the bar close to your shins. Remember, this first pull is performed slowly.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 4<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Upward Movement - Scoop or Transition: As the bar passes your knees, thrust your hips forward against the bar. Do not allow your low back to arch. This movement is performed \"explosively\".<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 5<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Upward Movement - 2nd Pull: While keeping the bar as close to your body as possible, continue to lift the bar explosively upwards. Straighten the hips and knees while simultaneously adding an explosive shrug and calf raise (see illustration from the side). This helps pull the bar higher from the floor. Due to the explosive nature of this phase, the torso may exhibit a slight arch, the head may tilt backward and the feet may leave the floor. The palms are still facing down and the bar is as close to your body as possible. When you have reached the point where your ankles, knees and hips are straight, start bending your elbows and flaring them out. This should occur as the bar reaches chest level.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 6<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Upward Movement: Catch: At full extension, rotate your wrists and arms under the bar while simultaneously flexing your hips and knees to drop your body under the bar. Once your arms move under the bar, push your elbows forward and upward until your upper arms or forearms are parallel to the floor. The bar is caught on the front edge of your shoulders immediately in front of your collarbones (similar to how the bar is held for a front squat). Often, lifters will relax their grip on the bar during the catch phase and allow the bar to roll closer to the body. This allows the individual to lift the elbows and upper arms up higher.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 7<br \/><\/h2>  <p>At the end of the catch phase, the torso should be near vertical, feet flat, head neutral and shoulders just forward of the hips. The catch phase ends as you stand up straight.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 8<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Lowering Movement: Grasp the bar, inhale and slowly lower your elbows to point toward the floor, moving the bar off the shoulders. As the bar reaches hip level, bend the hips and knees similar to a dead lift, lowering the body and bar to return it back to the floor.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 9<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Exercise Variation: A modification to the Power Clean is a Hang Clean where the bar starts at the mid-thigh position (end of the 1st Pull). This exercise may prove to be more difficult as without the 1st pull, much of the initial momentum needed in the 2nd pull is lost.<\/p>  <p>This advanced, power exercise requires the individual to lift the bar quickly and forcefully from the ground to shoulder height in one movement, divided into 4 distinct phases. It is recommended that the 4 phases be learned and mastered individually, then integrated together gradually (part-to-whole-learning). Additionally, as the squat and dead lift are integral to this exercise, they should be mastered before progressing to performing cleans.<\/p><\/span>                         <\/div>                      ","targetBodyPart":"Full Body\/Integrated","imageUrl":"\/acefit\/img\/exerciselibrary\/large\/125-1.jpg"},{"name":"Quadruped Bent-knee Hip Extensions","descriptionHtml":"                         <div>                              <span id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_ChildContent_lblSimpleText\"><h2>Step 1<\/h2>  <p>Starting Position: Come to a hands and knees (quadruped) position on an exercise mat or floor.

Engage your core and abdominal muscles, keeping the spine in neutral. Do not sag or arch the low back.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 2<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Maintain a strong, stable core and lift the left leg, keeping the knee bent. Engage the glute (butt) muscles to press the left foot upward toward the ceiling. Move only at the hip joint. Perform a number of repetitions with the left leg before switching legs and performing the same number of repetitions with the right leg.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 3 <br \/><\/h2>  <p>Exercise Variation: To increase the intensity of the exercise, place a dumbbell in the back of the knee.<br \/>The degree to which the leg can be pressed upward is determined by the ability to control\/prevent movement in the low back. As the leg is raised, individuals may notice the low back sagging. Only raise the leg to a height where the low back position can be stabilized by engaging the core and abdominal muscles.<\/p><\/span>                         <\/div>                      ","targetBodyPart":"Abs, Butt\/Hips","imageUrl":"\/acefit\/img\/exerciselibrary\/large\/270-1.jpg"},{"name":"Shoulder Packing","descriptionHtml":"                         <div>                              <span id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_ChildContent_lblSimpleText\"><h2>Step 1<\/h2>  <p>Starting Position: Stand with your feet hip-width apart, toes pointing forward, with arms by your sides.

When you press up onto your toes, feel a long line from your ankles all the way through your hips. Your ankles, knees and hips are fully extended.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 5 <br \/><\/h2>  <p>Exercise Variation: Increase the intensity of the exercise by performing the action in one explosive motion. <br \/>Start with light resistance then gradually progress this exercise by increasing the weight and increasing the pace of the exercise so that you begin to perform the movement explosively against heavier resistance.<\/p>  <p>Technique is very important in this lift. Do not progress to explosive movements until you master your technique.<\/p><\/span>                         <\/div>                      ","targetBodyPart":"Arms, Back, Butt\/Hips, Legs - Thighs, Shoulders, Full Body\/Integrated","imageUrl":"\/acefit\/img\/exerciselibrary\/large\/240-1.jpg"},{"name":"Single Leg Push-off","descriptionHtml":"                         <div>                              <span id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_ChildContent_lblSimpleText\"><h2>Step 1<\/h2>  <p>Starting Position: Stand facing a raised platform or a plyometric jump box. Place your right foot on the top of the step or box, keep your left foot on the ground, hinge forward from the hips. Arms are by your side and your head is level. Focus your gaze on the ground about two-to-three feet in front of you.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 2<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Upward phase: Jump straight up by pushing off with both feet and swinging your arms forward and up, making your body completely straight in the air. Imagine you are a rocket launching toward the ceiling. While in the air, your left foot must lift a little in order to keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 3<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Landing phase: The most important components of the landing phase are correct foot position and control of the forward movement in your knees. Excessive forward movement in the knees places additional stress on the joint. Try to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling into the heels. Always push your hips back and down to absorb the impact of landing. Do not lock out your knees on your landing. Land with your trunk slightly forward, head aligned with your spine and back rigid or flat. Keep your abdominal \/ core muscles engaged, bracing your torso to protect your spine.<br \/>When jumping keep your spine straight and tall by contacting your abdominals (bracing). Be sure to perform the same number of repetitions on each leg.<\/p><\/span>                         <\/div>                      ","targetBodyPart":"Butt\/Hips, Legs - Calves and Shins, Legs - Thighs","imageUrl":"\/acefit\/img\/exerciselibrary\/large\/230-1.jpg"},{"name":"Single Leg Squat","descriptionHtml":"                         <div>                              <span id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_ChildContent_lblSimpleText\"><h2>Step 1<\/h2>  <p>Starting Position: Stand with your feet hip width apart. The right foot should be slightly forward with the heel of the right foot lined up with the toes of the left foot. Your body weight should be over the right foot.

Pull your shoulder blades down and back. Keep these engagements throughout the exercise.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 2<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Downward Movement: With your weight balanced on the right foot and the toes of the left foot still on the floor, slowly begin to bend forward at the hips.

Keep your back flat and head aligned with your spine.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 3<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Keep the abdominals braced and the spine elongated. Push your weight back into your right hip while allowing the right knee to bend. Your arms may be at your side (as pictured) or held front of your body as a counter-balance. As you are lowering yourself, keep your weight into the standing (supporting) foot. Try to keep your pelvis level throughout the exercise. Do not allow your hips to shift or rotate.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 4<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Upward Movement: Keep your bodyweight in your right side, exhale and slowly push the right foot into the ground to straighten hip and knee and return to start position. The core should be bracing through the entire movement to support the spine; keep the hips level and control balance.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 5<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Perform a prescribed number of repetitions. Change sides and complete another set of repetitions on the other leg.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 6<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Exercise Variation: As this technique is mastered, the exercise intensity can be progressed by (1) lifting the supporting leg off of the floor. This increases the need for balance and stabilization within the body; (2) adding more resistance by holding a dumbbell in one hand or a medicine ball in both hands; (3) bending over and \/ or lowering the hips closer to the ground increasing your knee bend; and (4) standing on unstable surfaces (e.g., Airex pad).<\/p>  <p>Keep the stance foot flat on the floor during the entire range-of-motion of the movement; to emphasize the glutes, push your weight back into your hip during the lowering phase.<\/p><\/span>                         <\/div>                      ","targetBodyPart":"Butt\/Hips, Legs - Calves and Shins, Legs - Thighs","imageUrl":"\/acefit\/img\/exerciselibrary\/large\/136-1.jpg"},{"name":"Single Leg Stand","descriptionHtml":"                         <div>                              <span id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_ChildContent_lblSimpleText\"><h2>Step 1<\/h2>  <p>Starting Position: Stand with both feet together or spread a few inches apart (2-3\"), and parallel with each other.

From the side, the shinbone and torso should be parallel with one another and the low back should appear flat or showing the beginning of some rounding.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 8<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Upward Phase: While maintaining the position of your back, chest and head and with the abdominals engaged, exhale and return to start position by pushing your feet into the floor through your heels. The hips and torso should rise together. Keep the heels flat on the floor and knees aligned with the second toe.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 9<br \/><\/h2>  <p>At the end of the set, step forward into a split-stance position, dip down and re-rack the bar. <br \/>Technique is very important in this lift. The tendency is to hold the shinbone too vertical which forces you to lean your torso too far forward. Using a mirror for feedback, shift your shinbone forward while keeping your heels on the floor, then bring your torso more upright, but do so from the hips and not through the low back. Squeeze your abdominals to help prevent the excess arching in the back with this correction. If using a squat rack, the safety rungs on the rack should be positioned at mid-thigh level.<\/p><\/span>                         <\/div>                      ","targetBodyPart":"Back, Butt\/Hips, Legs - Thighs, Full Body\/Integrated","imageUrl":"\/acefit\/img\/exerciselibrary\/large\/11-1.jpg"},{"name":"Hip Rotations (Push-up Position)","descriptionHtml":"                         <div>                              <span id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_ChildContent_lblSimpleText\"><h2>Step 1<\/h2>  <p>This exercise is a dynamic movement exercise used to prepare the body for activity.

Slowly bend forward to place your palms flat on the mat, positioning your hands shoulder-width apart with your fingers facing forward or turned slightly inward. Slowly shift your weight forward until your shoulders are positioned directly over your hands. Reposition your hands as needed to allow full extension of your body without any bend at the hips or knees. Brace your torso by engaging your abdominal \/ core muscles. Contract your glutes and quadriceps (butt and thigh muscles), and align your head with your spine. Place your feet together with your toes tucked towards your shins.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 3<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Rotational Movement: Exhale and gently draw one knee up toward its corresponding armpit.

Assume the same starting position with your arms bent, but allow your hips to rotate to the left with your arms, increasing your degree of rotation. Your head, chest and torso should remain aligned over your hips. Much of your body weight should be loaded into your left leg.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 7<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Movement: Slowly, bring your arms down and across your body toward the right, while squatting down slightly to an end point where the medicine ball is positioned lower than your right hip (performing a wood chop movement).

Keep your feet, tailbone and low back in contact with the mat. <br \/>Proper form is important for this exercise to prevent excessive stress on your low back. Individuals typically perform this movement too rapidly and recruit the hip flexors to assist with the upward phase. Doing this should be avoided as it causes the pelvis to tilt anteriorly, increasing the stress on the low back. The abdominals connect the rib cage to the pelvis so the movement should focus on bringing these two body parts closer together while keeping the neck and shoulders relaxed.<\/p><\/span>                         <\/div>                      ","targetBodyPart":"Abs","imageUrl":"\/acefit\/img\/exerciselibrary\/large\/52-1.jpg"},{"name":"Squat Jumps","descriptionHtml":"                         <div>                              <span id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_ChildContent_lblSimpleText\"><h2>Step 1<\/h2>  <p>Starting Position: Stand with your feet hip-width apart, arms by your sides.

Grasp the bar slightly wider than your shoulders with the palms facing forward, elbows bent. Position the bar behind your head either: (1) High along the top of your shoulders at the base of your neck, or (2) Low across the back of the shoulders, requiring a slightly wider grip. Do not allow the shoulders to shrug.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 2<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Brace your torso by contracting your abdominal\/core muscles to stabilize your spine. Keep the chest lifted, and your head tilted slightly up.

Keep your torso upright.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 3<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Downward Phase: Bend your knees to lower your body towards the floor. Your torso may move slightly forward. As you continue to lower your body, both your torso and the right shinbone should now move slightly forward past vertical. However, do not allow excessive forward movement. The downward motion occurs by bending the left knee so that your weight is going more downward than forward.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 4<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Lunge to an end-point where you feel comfortable.

Place a weight on one end of the barbell with a collar so that the weight cannot fall off during the exercise. Stand facing the end of the barbell so that it is between both feet and directly under your center of gravity. Your feet should be slightly wider than shoulder-width with your toes pointed forward or slightly outward.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 2<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Squat down by shifting your hips back and down to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. As you lower your hips the knees will then start to shift forward slowly. Try to control excessive forward movement of the shinbones over the toes. Brace your core to keep your trunk stable and spine straight. Continue to lower yourself until your thighs are near, or parallel with the floor. If your heels begin to lift off the floor, or your torso begins to round or flex forward, you have lowered yourself too far. Lift the end of the barbell and firmly grasp it in both hands using a closed grip (thumbs wrapped around the bar and palms facing one another). Position the end of the bar in front of your chest, directly under your chin. Keep the abdominals engaged, the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), and shoulders pulled down and back (no shrugging). Your chest is lifted and your head is in line with your spine. Heels are on the floor, and shoulders are over or slightly in front of the bar. Your gaze is straight ahead or slightly upward.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 3<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Upward phase: Push your feet into the ground and drive your hips forward to straighten your legs. Keep the barbell in front of your chest as you press yourself back to standing. Monitor your feet, ankles and knees. Your knees should align over the second toe of each foot as you move to standing. Do not allow the ankles or feet to roll.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 4<br \/><\/h2>  <p>As you approach a full standing position quickly push through your heels, bringing the hips toward an upright position. Begin to press the end of the barbell upward. Brace your core and abdominal muscles to stabilize and protect your spine.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 5<br \/><\/h2>  <p>As the hips and knees fully straighten, continue pushing upward onto your toes while pressing the bar overhead. Feel the movement begin at the hips, travel through the trunk and continue through the shoulders and arms. Avoid arching your back during the overhead push. When you press up onto your toes, feel a long line from your ankles all the way through your hips. Your ankles, knees and hips are fully extended.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 6<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Exercise Variation: Increase the velocity or speed of the movement to transition from a strength exercise to a power-based exercise. <br \/>Start with light resistance then gradually progress this exercise by increasing the weight and increasing the pace of the exercise so that you begin to perform the movement explosively against heavier resistance.<\/p>  <p>Technique is very important in this lift.

Shift your weight towards your right picking up your right foot and explosively pushing your left foot into the ground to start moving to your right.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 3<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Continue to move to your right in this manner: picking up the right foot and placing it to the right while pushing the left foot into the ground to generate force and momentum for the sideways movement. Your feet should remain parallel with one another with the toes facing forward. As you shuffle, your whole foot is on the ground but your weight is forward and toward the balls of your feet. The shuffle emphasizes quickness and rapid foot movement.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 4<br \/><\/h2>  <p>At the far cone maintain your athletic ready position, shift your weight over your left leg, push off with the right foot and begin shuffling back to the starting point. Maintain your body position and quick pace throughout the duration of the drill.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 5<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Exercise Variation: Work with a coach or training partner to provide either visual cues: by signaling which direction to move with a hand gesture, e.g. pointing to the left to shuffle to the left; or verbal cues: by stating which direction to shuffle, e.g. stating \"right\" to shuffle to the right. <br \/>Maintain a wide base of support, as you shuffle your feet should remain at least hip-width apart to maintain dynamic balance as you move over the ground.<\/p><\/span>                         <\/div>                      ","targetBodyPart":"Butt\/Hips, Legs - Thighs","imageUrl":"\/acefit\/img\/exerciselibrary\/large\/181-1.jpg"},{"name":"Lateral Zig Zags","descriptionHtml":"                         <div>                              <span id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_ChildContent_lblSimpleText\"><h2>Step 1<\/h2>  <p>Starting Position: Lay out your cones as illustrated creating a zig-zag line for 10 - 15 yards (9 - 14 m).

Brace your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine and maintain your abdominals engaged throughout the exercise.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 3<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Squat down, then immediately explode upward in a diagonal direction over the cone in a direction towards the 2nd cone. Your jump should push through your the heels of your feet and extend your hips, knees and ankles in one movement. Swinging your arms upwards as you jump will increase your power and jumping ability. Maintain your foot alignment during the jump, landing with your feet aligned in the same position as when you jumped.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 4<br \/><\/h2>  <p>The most important components of the landing phase are correct foot position and control of the forward movement in your knees. Excessive forward movement in the knees places additional stress on the joint. Try to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling into the heels. Always push your hips back and down to absorb the impact of landing. Do not lock out your knees on your landing. Land with your trunk slightly forward, head aligned with your spine and back rigid or flat. Keep your abdominal \/ core muscles engaged, bracing your torso to protect your spine. Continue to drop into a 1\/2 squat position before exploding upward into another diagonal jump.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 5<br \/><\/h2>  <p>With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your downward phase, explode up through your lower body, fully extending your hips, knees and ankles jumping over the second cone with another diagonal jump. As your jump into the air, try to keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor. Continue this sequence until you have cleared all the cones.<br \/>Exercise Variation: Progress the drill intensity by jumping higher over the cones, spacing the cones further apart (4 - 6') or increasing the overall length of the grid. However, one set through the drills should not exceed 10 seconds (if performing at a 9 or 10-out-of-10 effort) or 15-20 yards for lower intensities.<\/p>  <p><br \/>Always learn the proper mechanics of landing before jumping. Alignment of the foot, knee and ankle, and the mechanics of landing are critical to minimizing injury associated with jumping activities.<\/p><\/span>                         <\/div>                      ","targetBodyPart":"Legs - Calves and Shins, Legs - Thighs","imageUrl":"\/acefit\/img\/exerciselibrary\/large\/272-1.jpg"},{"name":"Lunge with Overhead Press","descriptionHtml":"                         <div>                              <span id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_ChildContent_lblSimpleText\"><h2>Step 1<\/h2>  <p>Starting Position: Stand with your feet together.

Keeping the abdominals engaged will help to avoid any sideway tilting or swaying in your upper body. Press the standing foot firmly into the ground to reduce any unwanted movement and maintain stability. Hold this position briefly before stepping forward. The right foot should land on the floor heel first. With the right (forward) leg placed firmly on the floor, shift your body weight forward. Focus on lowering yourself downwards toward the floor rather than forward. As you load your bodyweight into the right leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the left (back) foot. As you lower yourself into your right leg and hip, push the medicine ball straight overhead. Keep the abdominals braced.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 3<br \/><\/h2>  <p>While still in the bottom (downward) phase of the lunge, pull the medicine ball back down to your chest.

Keep your wrists in line with your forearms (neutral) Maintain these engagements throughout the exercise.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 2<br \/><\/h2>  <p>From the start position, bend your elbows and pull your hands toward your ribs. Your elbows should glide close to the sides of your body. Keep the wrists in neutral position, and your chest in contact with the chest pad. Do not lean back or arching your low back. Keep your head as still as possible during the movement.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 3<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Continue pulling until your elbows pass the sides of your body. Pause briefly. In a slow and controlled manner, straighten your elbows to return to start position. As the weight begins to straighten your arms and the handles move away from your body, use your back muscles to resist the pull of the weight stack. Stop when your elbows are fully straight. Keep your torso an upright your chest lifted. Do not allow your spine bend forward or your back to round during this exercise. Repeat for a prescribed number of repetitions.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 4<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Exercise Variation: To increase the exercise intensity and involve additional exercises, perform the following variations:<br \/>(a) Perform unilateral (one arm at a time) pulls<br \/>(b) Move the chest pad away from your body, which will now require a greater effort to stabilize your trunk as you perform the pulling movement.<br \/><br \/>Allowing your shoulders to round forward as your arms extend will allow you to pull with more force. However, learn how to perform a pulling motion without scapulae (shoulder blade) movement first before introducing shoulder movement. Additionally, reduce unnecessary stresses into your low back by avoiding any backwards lean during the pull movements.<\/p><\/span>                         <\/div>                      ","targetBodyPart":"Arms, Back","imageUrl":"\/acefit\/img\/exerciselibrary\/large\/168-1.jpg"},{"name":"Seated Machine Shoulder Press ","descriptionHtml":"                         <div>                              <span id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_ChildContent_lblSimpleText\"><h2>Step 1<\/h2>  <p>Starting Position: Sit with your back firmly supported against the backrest.

Holding the ball, reach out both arms to touch your targets.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 4<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Your initial targets should be level with your chest and torso, or overhead, but positioned in front of your body so that it does not require any movement of your hips or torso.<br \/>Perform this activity for a prescribed time and repeat on the other side.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 5<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Exercise Variation: As you master the starting positions, increase the intensity of the exercise by (1) reaching down towards low targets that require either a forward bend in your torso or single-leg squat, or both; and (2) reaching low or high, and around to targets positioned below your waistline or above your shoulders.<br \/>Most of us can lift one leg, but the question of the quality of movement is important. Perform your movements slowly and under control, avoiding any sudden positional changes. Perform each progression until you can execute them with good control and form.<\/p><\/span>                         <\/div>                      ","targetBodyPart":"Abs","imageUrl":"\/acefit\/img\/exerciselibrary\/large\/114-1.jpg"},{"name":"Spinal Twist with a Push-Pull Movement","descriptionHtml":"                         <div>                              <span id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_ChildContent_lblSimpleText\"><h2>Step 1<\/h2>  <p>Starting Position: Lie on your side on a mat with both legs straight so that your hips and shoulders are stacked and vertical with the floor. Your spine and head should be aligned. Rest your head resting on the mat or upon a small pillow or rolled-up towel if necessary. Bend your top knee to create a 90-degree bend at both the hip and knee. Rest the inside of that knee on the mat or upon a raised surface (e.g. rolled-up towel, block, etc.). Reach both arms out directly in front you at chest level, stacking your hands one on top of the other.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 2<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Engage your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine in a neutral position and maintain this engagement throughout the exercise. Gently exhale. Slowly rotate your trunk and upper arm until your belly button faces the ceiling and your upper arm extends out to the other side, touching or slightly off the floor. <br \/>Avoid rotating your hips. If your upper thigh is sliding backward as you rotate, the hips are rotating. Placing a raised surface under the inside of the upper knee will help control this hip rotation. Do not allow the low back to arch. Keeping your abdominal muscles engaged will help prevent this.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 3<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Keep your shoulder blades pulled back and down throughout the exercise. Hold this position briefly, then bend the elbow of the lower arm so that the back of the arm is on the floor \/ mat, and the forearm is vertical to the floor. Reach the other arm toward the ceiling, but keep the shoulder blade down.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 4<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Gently exhale. Keeping your shoulder blades, trunk and hips stabilized, perform a series of push-pull movements with your arms:<\/p>  <p>(a) Press the lower arm upwards, extending the elbow without allowing the scapula to move forward<\/p>  <p>(b) Pull the upper arm downwards towards the chest, bending the elbow without allowing the scapula to move backwards.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 5<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Exercise Variation: The exercise intensity can be increased by using dumbbells.<\/p>  <p><br \/>To maximize the benefits of this exercise and reduce the potential for injury, it is important to stabilize the shoulder blades, trunk and hips and control movement at the shoulders.

Engage your abdominal and core muscles. Tuck your chin slightly toward your chest and slowly curl your torso toward your thighs. Since the abdominal muscles attach the rib cage to the pelvis, your movement should focus on pulling these two body parts closer together. Try to keep the neck relaxed. Your feet should be firmly planted, and your tailbone and lower back should remain in contact with the ball at all times. Continue to curl up until your upper back is off the ball. Hold this position briefly while maintaining your balance.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 4<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Downward Phase: Gently inhale and slowly uncurl, lowering your spine back towards the ball in a controlled fashion. The feet are planted, and your tailbone and low back stay connected to the ball.<br \/>Should balance prove to be a challenge, widen your base of support by moving your feet apart.

Perform a gentle contraction of the pelvic floor muscles without moving your hips, ribcage or spine. (Imagine resisting the urge to urinate).<br \/>. Draw your belly button upward toward the ribcage and more deeply toward the spine. Do not allow your hips, rib cage or spine to move. (Visualize narrowing at the waist like the number 8). Movement of the hips, rib cage or spine indicates that you are not using the correct muscles to perform this exercise.<br \/>. Combine both 1 and 2 above.<br \/>. Combine 1 and 2, but counting out loud while breathing normally (i.e. holding the contractions through normal breathing).<\/p>  <p><br \/>Once you have used a hollowing movement to stabilize your spine and pelvis, lift both legs and arms off of the floor; the knees should be directly over the hips and bent ninety degrees (pictured) and the elbows should be directly over the shoulder joints so your hands are pointed to the wall behind you in \"dead bug\" pose (pictured).<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 3<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Inhale.

Rotate until you feel a comfortable stretch in the trunk and shoulder. Avoid arching your back or rotating your hips. This will increase the stretch in the shoulder and chest, in addition to your trunk.<\/p>  <p>To maximize the benefits of this stretch and reduce the potential for injury, it is important to follow the instructions provided carefully.<\/p><\/span>                         <\/div>                      ","targetBodyPart":"Abs, Back, Chest, Shoulders","imageUrl":"\/acefit\/img\/exerciselibrary\/large\/229-1.jpg"},{"name":"Thomas Stretch","descriptionHtml":"                         <div>                              <span id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_ChildContent_lblSimpleText\"><h2>Step 1<\/h2>  <p>Sit at the end of a massage table so that the edge of the table crosses at about mid-thigh.

Your arms are by your sides. Brace your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine. Pull your shoulder blades down your back. Try to keep these engagements throughout the exercise. Slowly lift both feet off the floor. Straighten your knees until your thighs are vertical to the floor. Your toes can point away from your body. (DO NOT move your thighs beyond this point as that shifts your body weight from your butt into your low back, causing increased stress to the low back). Put your hands on your thighs. Shoulder blades are flat on the floor.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 2<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Gently exhale. Use your abdominals to bring your head and shoulders of the floor, curling the spine.

Pull your shoulders blades down and back without arching your low back. Engage your abdominal\/core muscles to stabilize your spine. Hold a medicine ball in front of your mid-section firmly holding it with both hands.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 2<\/h2>  <p>Step forward: Slowly lift the right foot off the floor, finding your balance on the standing leg. Keeping the abdominals engaged will help to avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body. Press the standing foot firmly into the ground to reduce any unwanted movement and maintain stability. Hold this position briefly before stepping forward. The right foot should land on the floor heel first. With the right (forward) leg placed firmly on the floor, shift your body weight forward. Focus on lowering yourself downward toward the floor rather than forward. As you load your bodyweight into the right leg, avoid any sideway tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the left (back) foot.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Step 3<br \/><\/h2>  <p>Continue lowering your body to a comfortable position or until the front thigh is parallel with the floor and the shinbone is in a slight forward lean.
